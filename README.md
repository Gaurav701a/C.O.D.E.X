# Tracy - AI Assistant of project C.O.D.E.X

## Project Overview
Tracy is an AI assistant designed to assist developers working on the CODEX project. This project involves creating an Android application that utilizes SQLite for managing user details. The application provides functionality to insert, update, delete, and retrieve user information from a SQLite database.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

1. `DBHelper.java`: This file contains the implementation of the `DBHelper` class, which extends `SQLiteOpenHelper`. It provides methods for creating and upgrading the database, inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving user data.

## Usage
To use Tracy and the CODEX project, follow these steps:

1. Include the `DBHelper.java` file in your project's source code.
2. Initialize an instance of `DBHelper` by passing the application context and the name of the database file.
3. Call the `insertuserdata()` method to insert user data into the SQLite database.
4. Call the `updateuserdata()` method to update user data in the database.
5. Call the `deletedata()` method to delete user data from the database.
6. Call the `getdata()` method to retrieve user data from the database as a `Cursor` object.

## Example Usage

```java
// Create an instance of DBHelper
DBHelper dbHelper = new DBHelper(context);

// Insert user data
Boolean isInserted = dbHelper.insertuserdata("John Doe", "1234567890", "1990-01-01");
if (isInserted) {
    // Data inserted successfully
} else {
    // Failed to insert data
}

// Update user data
Boolean isUpdated = dbHelper.updateuserdata("John Doe", "9876543210", "1990-01-01");
if (isUpdated) {
    // Data updated successfully
} else {
    // Failed to update data
}

// Delete user data
Boolean isDeleted = dbHelper.deletedata("John Doe");
if (isDeleted) {
    // Data deleted successfully
} else {
    // Failed to delete data
}

// Retrieve user data
Cursor cursor = dbHelper.getdata();
if (cursor != null && cursor.moveToFirst()) {
    do {
        // Process each row of user data
        String name = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex("name"));
        String contact = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex("contact"));
        String dob = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex("dob"));

        // Perform desired operations with the retrieved data

    } while (cursor.moveToNext());
    cursor.close();
}
```
